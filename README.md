# Adroitness-Mobile
Adroitness is an efficient Android-based middleware for building robust, high-performance interactive apps, alleviating the burdensome task of dealing with low-level architectural decisions and fine-grained implementation details by focusing on the separation of concerns and abstracting away the complexity of orchestrating device sensors and effectors, decision-making processes, and connection to remote services, while providing scaffolding for the development of higher-level functional features of interactive high-performance mobile apps.
